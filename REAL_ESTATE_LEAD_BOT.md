# Real Estate Lead Bot

## 1. Overview

The Real Estate Lead Bot is an AI-assisted lead intake and qualification system for **PrimeHomes Realty**. It receives natural-language property enquiries, extracts structured requirements, stores the lead, evaluates qualification and urgency, responds to the customer, alerts the sales team when appropriate, and tracks the lead through its lifecycle.

## 2. Example enquiries

- “Hi, I'm looking for a 3-bedroom apartment around Lekki. My budget is around N80 million.”
- “Do you have any 2-bedroom apartments in Ikeja?”
- “I need land around Ibadan, preferably below N20 million.”
- “Hello, I want to buy a house.”

The system must handle both highly detailed and incomplete enquiries without inventing missing information.

## 3. Product promise

The system should turn unstructured property conversations into reliable, actionable sales records while keeping the customer experience conversational and allowing a human salesperson to take over at any point.

## 4. Core architecture

```text

PostgreSQL / Sales Team

### Responsibilities

- **React:** presentation, chat, lead views and sales UI.
- **FastAPI:** API contracts, validation, authorization, business logic and database access.
- **n8n:** workflow orchestration, integrations, routing, scheduled automation and notifications.
- **AI:** natural-language understanding, extraction, classification, summarization and response drafting.
- **PostgreSQL:** authoritative application state.

## 5. Lead lifecycle

```text
NEW → CONTACTED → QUALIFIED → FOLLOW_UP → PROPERTY_MATCHED
→ VIEWING_SCHEDULED → NEGOTIATION → CONVERTED
```

Possible terminal/exception states include `LOST`, `CLOSED`, `NOT_INTERESTED`, and `UNQUALIFIED`.

**Lead status** represents sales-process position. **Qualification** represents current lead quality/value. **AI confidence** represents confidence in AI interpretation. These must remain separate.
