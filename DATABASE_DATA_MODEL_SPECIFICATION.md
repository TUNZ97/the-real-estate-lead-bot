# Database Data Model Specification

## 1. Purpose

Define the PostgreSQL model that stores authoritative business state for the Real Estate Lead Bot.

## 2. Core entities

### customers
Represents a person interacting with PrimeHomes.

Suggested fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

### leads
Represents a property-sales/rental opportunity.

Suggested fields: `id`, `customer_id`, `status`, `intent`, `property_type`, `location_text`, `bedrooms`, `budget_min`, `budget_max`, `currency`, `timeframe`, `qualification_level`, `qualification_score`, `urgency`, `qualification_version`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

### conversations
Represents a customer interaction thread.

Suggested fields: `id`, `customer_id`, `lead_id`, `status`, `channel`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

### messages
Immutable conversation messages where possible.

Suggested fields: `id`, `conversation_id`, `sender_type`, `content`, `external_message_id`, `created_at`, metadata.

### lead_activities
Audit-friendly business events such as status changes, qualification changes, assignment, handoff and follow-up completion.

### follow_ups
Tracks scheduled actions: `id`, `lead_id`, `due_at`, `status`, `reason`, `assigned_to`, `completed_at`.

### users / sales users
Authenticated internal users with roles such as `SALES_AGENT`, `SALES_MANAGER`, `ADMIN`.

### notifications
Tracks sales notifications and delivery state.

### ai_processing_logs (optional)
Stores model/provider, prompt/schema versions, outcome, confidence and timing without unnecessarily storing sensitive raw content.

## 3. Relationships

```text
Customer 1 ─── * Lead
Customer 1 ─── * Conversation
Lead 1 ─── * Conversation
Conversation 1 ─── * Message
Lead 1 ─── * Activity
Lead 1 ─── * FollowUp
Lead 1 ─── * Notification
```

## 4. Enumerations

Intent: `BUY`, `RENT`, `SELL`, `PROPERTY_ENQUIRY`, `GENERAL_ENQUIRY`, `UNKNOWN`.

Property type: `APARTMENT`, `HOUSE`, `DUPLEX`, `LAND`, `OFFICE`, `COMMERCIAL`, `OTHER`, `UNKNOWN`.

Timeframe: `IMMEDIATE`, `WITHIN_1_MONTH`, `WITHIN_3_MONTHS`, `OVER_3_MONTHS`, `RESEARCHING`, `UNKNOWN`.

Qualification: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `UNKNOWN`.

Urgency: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `UNKNOWN`.

Conversation: `ACTIVE`, `WAITING_FOR_CUSTOMER`, `ESCALATED`, `CLOSED`.

Message sender: `CUSTOMER`, `BOT`, `SALES_AGENT`, `SYSTEM`.

Follow-up: `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`, `OVERDUE`.

Lead status: `NEW`, `CONTACTED`, `QUALIFIED`, `FOLLOW_UP`, `PROPERTY_MATCHED`, `VIEWING_SCHEDULED`, `NEGOTIATION`, `CONVERTED`, `LOST`, `CLOSED`, `NOT_INTERESTED`, `UNQUALIFIED`.

## 5. Data rules

- Use UUIDs or another stable non-sequential identifier.
- Store timestamps in UTC.
- Use `NUMERIC/DECIMAL` for money, never floating point.
- Preserve original customer messages.
- Use nullable fields for genuinely unknown values.
- Avoid destructive deletes for business records; prefer lifecycle/soft-deletion strategies where required.
- Keep `external_message_id` unique when supplied by an external channel.

## 6. Indexing

Index common access paths such as lead status, qualification, assigned user, follow-up due date, conversation ID, customer ID, created timestamps and external message IDs.

## 7. Migrations

Use Alembic. Every schema change must have a migration, be reviewed and be tested against representative data. Never silently change production schema manually.

## 8. Integrity

Foreign keys should enforce valid relationships. Domain validation belongs in application services in addition to database constraints.

## 9. Source-of-truth rule

n8n execution history is workflow evidence, not the business database. Google Sheets is an integration/reporting copy. AI logs are processing evidence. PostgreSQL owns current business state.
